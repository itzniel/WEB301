				football or soccer is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players who primarily
				use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch.

			 The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposite team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing side. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45 minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is considered the world's most popular sport.
			The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference.

			Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
			Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
			when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
			specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
			software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

			<div class="col-4">Why do we use it?
			It is a long established fact that a reader will be 
			distracted by the readable content of a page when
			looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem 
			Ipsum as their default model text,
			 and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their 
			 infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
			  sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

			 content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
